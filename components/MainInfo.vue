          Inglewood is not only Calgary's oldest neighbourhood but also
          undoubtedly one of its coolest. Located at the confluence of the Bow
          and Elbow Rivers, an important traditional gathering place for the
          Blackfoot Nation, Inglewood is full of charming local restaurants,
          shops, and historic buildings. Despite being next to Calgary's
          downtown core, Inglewood has retained a small-town vibe and is both
          walkable and bike-friendly.
